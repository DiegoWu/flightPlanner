# US Airports FlightPlanner

## Overview

US Airports FlightPlanner is a project developed for UW-Madison CS 400, Project 3. This tool helps users plan flights across various US airports by leveraging the Dijkstra algorithm for optimal route planning. The project was developed as a group effort by three team members.

## Features

- **Flight Planning**: Plan the shortest route between two US airports.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface built with JavaFX.
- **Real-time Data**: Utilizes real-world airport data from Kaggle.

## Technologies

### Frontend

- **JavaFX**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

### Backend

- **Dijkstra Algorithm**: For finding the shortest paths between airports.

## Data Source

- **Kaggle**: The project uses airport data sourced from Kaggle.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:DiegoWu/flightPlanner.git
    cd flightPlanner
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    Ensure you have Java installed. This project requires Java 11 or later.

3. **Run the Application**
    You can run the project using your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or via the command line:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**
    Open the application through your IDE or by executing the `make` command as mentioned in the setup.

2. **Plan a Flight**
    - Select your departure and destination airports.
    - The application will compute and display the shortest route using the Dijkstra algorithm.

3. **Explore Features**
    - Use the interactive map and additional UI elements to explore various functionalities.
